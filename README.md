# Raycasting in TypeScript

![screenshot](./screenshot.png)

My take on Raycasting inspired by Lode's Computer Graphics Tutorial: https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html

No Web-server is required, just open index.html with a browser. You can also visit GitHub pages: https://tsoding.github.io/raycasting/

## Rebuilding index.js

```console
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```
